Description: The goal of this homework assignment is to build an R package building off of the code for the sparse vector class in Homework 5. I have written roxygen2-style documentation for the functions and added unit tests for appropriate coverage. These functions have passed the R CMD check list of checks and have a GitHub Action that runs R CMD check every time a change is pushed to Github.
